# Skeleton

This is a very basic WordPress theme that can be used as the starting point for
larger, more complex themes.

## Development

To develop on Skeleton, I recommend using Flywheel Local to initialize a local
environment.

After spinning up an instance, be sure to run `sass --watch ./style.scss:./style.css`
if editing styles.
